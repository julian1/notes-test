  The main problem is that in order to use coq or agda, you need to learn
  Martin-Lof type theory (or calculus of inductive constructions, which is a
  similar formalism to MLTT) first, and learn to write code later. Otherwise
  everything will seem like a magic. There are however, good books on the topic:

  * Type Theory and Functional Programming
  * (http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/)

  * Programming in Martin-Lof type theory
    * (http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/book/)

Agda, Epigram or Idris. Which one to learn
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/132kg0/agda_epigram_or_idris_which_one_to_learn/

  - Coq is better for proving, but worse for programming than Agda.
  - Idris lacks interactive program building. Coq is better for proving, but worse for programming than Agda.
  - Iridis - Theorem proving is only supported up to making the compiler happy.
  - Coq - The tactics language, albeit untyped, exists at least. For big developements it's really a killer feature.
  - Coq is very verbose and hides a lot of things.
  - Coq - don't like tactics? Fine, write your proof by hand in Coq like you would do in Agda.
  - Coq is currently the best language for large scale theorem proving. Agda is an extremely nice language for dependent typed programming.
