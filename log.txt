TODO
  - read rest of yellow paper.

  The Book of Proof  (print / read)
    -  http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/
        available to download/print.

  conceptual mathematics: a first introduction to categories
    - 

  Simple Algebraic Data Types. Categories for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski
    - https://www.reddit.com/comments/2saoxl
    - https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/13/simple-algebraic-data-types/

  Category theory for programmers
    https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/

  Category Theory for Scientists
    - http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/CT4S.pdf
        early edition - mostly  on web
  
    - A good background in proofs/set theory should suffice. I would recommend
    "Book of Proof" by Richard Hammack as a prequel to this book. 

    - i highly recommend taking a look into category theory, in particular the
      books, 
        - "conceptual mathematics: a first introduction to categories" and 
        - "category theory for the sciences", 
      in that order.
      (eg. "book of proof" and "conceptual mathematics" are the recommended prerequisites)

  Practical Foundations of Mathematics
    http://paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/html/index.html
    - more advanced - have to buy

Hmmm, opportunity cost of holding an asset, is to convert it (borrow against it, sell it etc), and 
  invest in something that improves business.

  money isn't valueable to banks it's the interest they can charge on loans 
  
  on that basis thedao (which is channeling funds) is more interesting than maker (price stable asset). 

  blockchain contracts can be more expressive, the more resources and services are defined on the "consensus ledger"

- solitidy - coq/ functional program - if want to integrate then need more solidity experience to do this.
- can do 50% solidity - contract basis - means can put stuff on resume.
